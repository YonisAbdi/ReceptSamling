## Product Description

The Recipe Collection Application is an interactive platform for culinary enthusiasts to explore and save a variety of recipes. During the testing phase, the application focuses on core functionalities that provide users with the ability to search through a diverse set of recipes, save their favorites, and have a persistent local storage mechanism.
